# Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch16 → smaller, faster, lighter model 
# (~86M parameters). Good for real‑time use, lower memory, quick embedding generation.
#MODEL_ID=Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch16

# Xenova/clip-vit-large-patch14 → much bigger 
# (~428M parameters), slower but more accurate. Captures finer semantic detail, 
# better for high‑precision search or nuanced tasks.

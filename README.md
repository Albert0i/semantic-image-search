### Semantic Image Search
> "Every struggle, no matter what its goal, is forced by life to make
adjustments; it becomes a different struggle, serves different ends,
and sometimes accomplishes the very opposite of what it set out to
do. *Only slight goals are worth pursuing, because only a slight goal
can be entirely fulfilled.* "<br /><br />"Todo esforço, qualquer que seja o fim para que tenda, sofre, ao manifestar-se, os desvios que a vida lhe impõe; torna-se outro esforço, serve outros fins, consuma por vezes o mesmo contrário do que pretendera realizar. *Só um baixo fim vale a pena, porque só um baixo fim se pode inteiramente efetuar.*"<br/>--- The Book of Disquiet by Fernando Pessoa


#### Prologue
In the year of 2026, when "[AI slop](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/microsofts-nadella-wants-us-to-stop-thinking-of-ai-as-slop/)" and "[Microslop](https://cybernews.com/ai-news/microsoft-ai-microslop-copilot/?utm_source=cn_facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=cybernews&utm_content=post&source=cn_facebook&medium=social&campaign=cybernews&content=post)" become internet buzzwords, these impose introspection to what AI can do good for human being. While most AI concept *stagnate* on fancystage, the very technique that prevails is *AI features* like  **semantic search**. 

I have to reinstate that all tools invented should help and thus facilitate human life; not monitor, spy and surveillance purpose.
